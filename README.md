# Arkanoid (Java 17 + JavaFX + Gradle)

[![Java CI](https://github.com/yoadlotan124/Arkanoid/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yoadlotan124/Arkanoid/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A modern, object-oriented Java recreation of the classic **Arkanoid / Breakout** arcade game.  
Originally built for a university OOP course; now refactored to **JavaFX** with cleaner architecture, improved physics, and a future-ready design.

## ðŸŽ® Features
- Paddle + ball gameplay with brick destruction  
- Fixed-timestep style update (driven by JavaFX `AnimationTimer`)
